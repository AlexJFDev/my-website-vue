Capstone is a special program for seniors at my high school. Each student has an internship, job, or some other kind of training experience. Students do their Capstone every day after school. For my Capstone I am working in the IT department at a local research institution.
Part of the curriculum requires me to write about my experiences or answer a prompt every month so I am posting these writings here.`,
